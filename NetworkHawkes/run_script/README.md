# Running Network Hawkes model

This folder contains the running script to produce results used in my prelim report. 

To run the scripts, first set up the correct location of dependencies by adding the following to the ~/.bashrc file (or other locations and source it).

```
alias javalib='java -cp .:~/NetworkHawkes/library/\*'
alias javaclib='javac -cp ~/NetworkHawkes/library/\*'
```
