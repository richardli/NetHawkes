This is the repository for my Stochastic Prelim Exam. 

The paper to reproduce is Discovering Latent Network Structure in Point Process Data. (Linderman and Adams, 2014).

The main algorithm is carried out in Java. There is a R codes folder containing R scripts also used in the process.

Special thanks to Scott Linderman's kind help alone the way!
